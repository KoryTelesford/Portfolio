        <p> My name is Kory Telesford (Well you knew that already from the title and what is displaying ontop of you) but... let me talk a little about my self since thats what you clicked on the about section for. I was born and raised in the Good ole USA and currently live in New York City in Brooklyn, I love coding and have been doing it since I was 8 (can you belive that! :O) anyway, the first coding launguage I learned was java and created a flash game, just a simple little mario copy game never came to releasing it, and through out the years I have evolved from 2D flash games written in java to 3D kind Of AAA quality games made in C# and I am proud of what I was able to accomplish through out the years I am still a little rusty when it comes to web development because I havn't touched html in a while and just focused on C# but I am dedicated to learn both and I know with some practice I will be able to achive this, then I will be able to make games and also make top-quality websites, and with the help of scripted teaching me how to do this... It just gets easier and easier. </p>
